Ten prerecorded I/Q sample files can be downloaded from the link sent via email
and posted on Avenue.

There is NO need to copy all the sample files at once into your data sub-folder.
Instead, it is recommended to download one file at a time and overwrite the
iq_samples.raw file in the data sub-folder, which is the default path used by the script.

For those of you with the RF dongle and Raspberry Pi kit at home, the command-line
instructions for recording RF data are provided below. After installing the necessary
drivers to work with the RF dongle, the 8-bit unsigned values for the I/Q pairs can be
recorded using the following command:

rtl_sdr -f 99.9M -s 2.4M - > iq_samples.raw

The above command assumes that we are tuned to the FM station at 99.9 MHz, using an
RF sample rate of 2.4 Msamples/sec, and saving the data to a file named iq_samples.raw
(you can change the filename as needed).

For the above command, data acquisition runs indefinitely and must be stopped manually
by pressing Ctrl+C. If you want to stop recording after a predefined number of samples,
e.g., 12 million I/Q pairs (equivalent to 5 seconds at 2.4 Msamples/sec), you can
include an additional argument:

rtl_sdr -f 99.9M -s 2.4M -n 12000000 - > iq_samples.raw

To verify that the raw I/Q data has been recorded properly, place the file in your
project repository's data sub-folder and run the Python script from the model sub-folder.
The script should generate both .png image files (showing PSD estimates) and a .wav file.

In the source code below (at the beginning of the main function), you can observe where
the raw_data is read and where the normalization of the 8-bit unsigned I/Q samples to
32-bit float samples (in the range -1 to +1) is performed. While using 32-bit floats and
normalizing to the range -1 to +1 are optional choices (commonly adopted by many
third-party SDR software implementations), it is up to each project group to decide how
to handle the 8-bit unsigned I/Q samples in their Python model and C++ implementation.
For example, one can choose how to reformat the data in the range -1 to +1 in 64-bit double
format (as shown in the lines commented below the normalization to 32-bit floats). Note,
however, it is recommended to use the same data format in both the Python model and C++.

A final but critical note: the .gitignore file should NOT be modified to allow pushing
.raw files to GitHub. Including .raw files in the repository will result in very large
repositories that take excessive time to clone, pull, or push. As outlined in the
reference .gitignore file, only source files should be kept in your repositories.
"""

"""
For the project release, we recommend working in 64-bit double format, as the
memory overhead is acceptable. Therefore, the normalization of 8-bit unsigned
I/Q samples has been performed in 64-bit double format.
